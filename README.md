# RaptorMP

A fast, light and customizable Eclipse MicroProfileâ„¢-middleware.

## Goals

Every project should have some goals, so let's reach for the stars. ðŸ˜‰

* Extension-based - if you only need a REST-API then only the JAX-RS and the bootstrapper should be in your final JAR.
* Implements all MicroProfile specs and passes the TCK.
* Pure Java, no trickery which makes it "similar" to Java, but not quite.
* Nothing custom, only open standards and its implementations (preferably RIs).
* Have a Maven-plugin that helps to AOT/CDS/Jlink an entire project into a fast-to-start executable.
* Attempt to be Jakarta EE-compatible so users can add their own frameworks to be a more complete middleware (JNDI/JPA/JTA/EJBLite?)
* Support the latest Java LTS (i.e. 11) but preferably also the tween-versions (12,13,14...). Java 8, 9 or 10 are no priority, though.
* Be amongst the fastest MicroProfile-implementations (time to first response, tps).

## Suggested libs

* Undertow for HTTP/Servlet 4.x
* SmallRye for MicroProfile
* Weld for CDI 2
* Jersey for JAX-RS and RESTClient
